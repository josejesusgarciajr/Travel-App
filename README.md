# Travel-App
A travel App... Not to be used, not to be downloaded

## Dropped Pins Implemented
On Google Maps, the user can touch and hold on the map to place a marker at that location.
Tap the marker to view the custom marker window that displays the associated name, coordinates, rating, and description.

## Editable Pin Window
User can tap on a pin to view a custom marker window. The custom marker window will now have an edit option for the user to directly input the name and description of the location.

## Improved Pin Window
User can touch and hold on the map to navigate to the input window. User will be prompted to input place and description. User can swipe to rate the place with stars. The rating will be in 0.5 increments. Potential to me combined with LandmarkFragment as popup window.
